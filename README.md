# micro:bit Friend Detector

The [BBC micro:bit](https://amzn.to/2UxQNiM) is a pocket-sized computer that allows you to have loads of fun whilst learning digital technology and computer science. You can program it using block-based coding and build anything from lighting up LEDs to robots, musical instruments and more.

# BBC micro:bit Friend Detector

The [BBC micro:bit](https://amzn.to/2UxQNiM) is a pocket-sized computer that allows you to have loads of fun whilst learning digital technology and computer science. You can program it using block-based coding and build anything - from simple programs to light up LEDs, to robots, musical instruments and more.

In this tutorial, you will create a friend detector - a wrist-mounted gadget that lights up with a smiley face when your friends are nearby.

## What you will need

* A [BBC micro:bit]((https://amzn.to/2UxQNiM)) - you can buy one from Amazon by following [this link](https://amzn.to/2UxQNiM)
* A computer connected to the internet
* A micro USB cable (if you by the micro:bit Go kit linked above it contains this already). You may need a UBC-C to USB-A adapter if your computer only has USB-C ports (for example modern Macs).
* A micro:bit battery pack and batteries (if you by the micro:bit Go kit linked above it contains this already)
* Some duct tape (I recommend this [rainbow duct tape](https://amzn.to/2XLnFGN))
* Velcro
